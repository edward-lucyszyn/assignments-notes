\section{Introduction}

The aim of this challenge is to classify given geographical areas into six classes (Demolition, Road, Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Mega Projects) using features already extracted from satellite images of the areas. Since the objective is to identify the eventual purpose of the buildings under construction, satellite images are captured at various stages of the building process. These extracted features consist of numerical data such as the dates when successive photos were taken, as well as the means and standard deviations of the primary colors in each photo. Additionally, categorical features include the urban and geographical neighborhood, as well as the construction status at different dates. The name of the team on Kaggle is \textbf{MJ}.
