\section{Summary}

This project has been a great opportunity to apply the principles covered in class. It allowed us to understand in more detail the various algorithms, but also to gain a professional perspective as data scientists. Indeed, we had to go through all the steps of the project, including preprocessing the data, which we had not seen much in class, especially dealing with missing data. Then, we had to test several models and find the right model with the right set of hyperparameters to achieve the best possible result. We are satisfied with this project, which serves as a good conclusion to the Machine Learning course.
